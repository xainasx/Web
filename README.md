# Coventry University Publications Web Crawler ðŸ“šðŸ¤–

## Overview

This project is a Python-based web crawler and search utility designed to collect and analyze research publication metadata from the Coventry University Pure Portal. It automates the extraction of publication titles, authors, links, and dates, storing them in a CSV file. The notebook then enables efficient searching and text-based analysis of the collected data, making it ideal for academic research, data science projects, or anyone interested in Coventry University's research output.
